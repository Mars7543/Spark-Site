        <h3>What other things do you do besides freshman orientation?</h3>
        <p>Spark is actually involved in a variety of events Bergen County Academies. Other than orientation, the group organizes Week of Respect, Safe Schools Week, Staff Appreciation Week, and are also helpers at the PPO Picnic and induction. Spark juniors also help our guidance counselors teach freshman seminar and act as mentors for the freshmen in these classes. Outside of BCA, we are invloved in the Bleshman School Dance where we have fun with the students with disabilities that attend the school.</p>

        <h3>How much of a time committment is SPARK?</h3>
        <p>SPARK is in fact a huge time committment. There are periods in the year where SPARK is inactive but when it is active, it is expected to be considered a top priority. While there are leaders of certain committees that organize events, it is important to attend morning meetings and be able to stay after when required because at the end of the day, SPARK operates as a team. We do stay after most half-days, which is part of that committment</p>
